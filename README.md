## About The Project

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. Contributions are particularly important as they increase the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

The project scope was to create a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). By quickly and easily creating a README file (by using a command line application to generate one) a project creator has more time to devote to working on their project.

The application will be invoked by using the following in the command line:

```
node index.js
```
Because this application cannot be deployed on GitHub, a walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality below. 

## Demo

#### The following is a video of the application and performance and functionality:

[See how it works!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4zXaSV2mI8s10g4S24mR-Zy03rPBWXd/view?usp=sharing)  

#### The following is an excerpt of the application's code:

## User Story
```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```
